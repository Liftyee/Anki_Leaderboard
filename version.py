<h2>Anki Leaderboard {version}</h2>
This add-on ranks all of its users by the number of cards reviewed today, time spend studying today, 
current streak, reviews in the past 31 days, and retention. You can also compete against friends, join a group, 
and join a country leaderboard. You'll only see users, that synced on the same day as you.<br><br>
In the league tab, you see everyone that synced at least once during the current season. There are four leagues
(Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta). A season lasts two weeks. You don't have to sync every day.
<b>Starting from season 6,</b> the XP formula is:<br><code>XP = days studied percentage x ((6 x time) + (2 x reviews x retention))</code>
<i><a href="https://github.com/ThoreBor/Anki_Leaderboard/issues/122">See this issue for more info<a/></i><br>
At the end of each season, the top 20% will be promoted, and the last 20% will be relegated.<br><br>
