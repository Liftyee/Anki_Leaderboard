# Anki Leaderboard
Leaderboard for Anki 2.1

This add-on creates a leaderboard that ranks all of its users by current streak, number of cards reviewed today and time spend studying 
today. You can also invite friends and just compete against them.

### Installing

You can also download the newest version on Github. It might not be stable though. Open Anki go to Tools>Add-ons(Ctrl+Shift+A)>select the leaderboard add-on>View Files and replace those files with the ones you downloaded. Restart Anki afterwards.
